# QuizGenerator
A quiz generator written in python. Inspired by the Automate the Boring Stuff US state capitals quiz project (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter9/).

This CLI tool allows a user to either generate quiz files (in .txt format) or take a practice quiz in the console using the 'practice' command line argument.
